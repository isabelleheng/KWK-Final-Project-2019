      <p class="one"> I met my partner at Atlanta Pride five years ago. I was actually homeless and couchsurfing for about a year right before I met them. Bit of a whirlwind romance, and I moved to New Orleans with basically nothing other than a really amazing, trans spiritual family who all moved to New Orleans at the same time.
In the south, everything is still very segmented by identity, whereas in Philly, the segments still exist but they coexist a lot more together. And that’s been really relieving.
With our roommates, we have an all-queer/trans household, which is amazing and really supportive. Having so much of a shared vocabulary, that also just relieves so much pressure to have to try to explain points of view or explain things that are going on in our lives. It takes so much pressure off in a lot of ways, because we don’t really have to use the energy of explaining what’s going on, and we can just focus more on living our lives.
The extended drag weirdos of Philadelphia is kind of like my family here. There’s been six attempts to start Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in Philly in the last decade, and we’re the first that actually took off. It’s like my identity as a clown nun has been stronger and more integrated than many of my other identities for a period of time. It’s one of those things where it’s just kind of like, when I experienced it and had the ability to grab onto it, it was like" “OK, I definitely know I’m this.” Everything else is kind of up in the air, but this one thing I really know and understand about myself, and know this is kind of an integral part of what my life is and what I want my life to be.
It’s been an amazing opportunity to show our local community what the Sisters are. We definitely are rethinking what it means to be re-radicalized nuns in a way. But really this kind of extended community of drag folks and Sisters in Philly are really kind of what I consider my family. </p>

<p class="one"> All transgender narratives are different. Some narratives include tales of people discovering that they don’t fit neatly into a binary category, and I’m one of those people. About a year ago, I came out as bi-gender, which falls under the wide umbrella of the term "genderqueer," which describes people who do not fit neatly into a category of a binary gender. For example, a genderqueer person may identify as being not entirely male, not entirely female, both, neither, or something different from male or female. Gender expression of genderqueer ranges from masculine to feminine and vice versa, with androgynous perched somewhere in the middle. Expression and identity of genderqueer people do not need to correlate with traditional gender — for example, one need not embrace masculine expression for a male identity.
I stepped into the workplace on my first day at my new job and I asserted my name and pronouns. I came out because I did a lot of research to find the word that I was looking for to describe myself. Some people love to ask me if I came out to follow a trend. I came out because language to describe myself became more available to me, and transgender celebrities like Laverne Cox started speaking out. If that makes me a trend follower, so be it.
In my year of exploring life as an “out” genderqueer person, I made several observations about the genderqueer experience. Here are eight truths about being genderqueer.
