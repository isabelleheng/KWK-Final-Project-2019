      <p class="one"> Twenty-four-year-old Kiley Lyall runs marathons and was selected as the people's choice winner for Women's Running cover contest. She was diagnosed with autism at age three after suffering a Grand Mal seizure and her doctor noticing she had autistic signs.
She got into running at the age of 8 when when she was asked to run the final leg of a relay with all boys in the Special Olympics. Describing her love of running she explains, "I realized how much better running made me feel and all I wanted to do was keep racing." It helped her confidence a great deal as well, improving her socializing ability and communication. Sometimes starting races with large crowds is problematic for her. She now dreams of becoming a fitness model and photographer.
Lyall is most proud of finishing her first half marathon despite two bouts of Grande Mal seizures. She broke down not knowing if she could go on, but her coach, who herself was fighting breast cancer, came to finish the race with Lyall and her mom.
Her biggest advice to parents with autistic children is to pay attention to what makes them happy and excited and "introduce them to new activities related to their likes." It will help find out what they are best at.</p>
      <p class="one"> Growing up as an autistic has never been easy.
At 5, I was diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified, or PDD-NOS, one of the five autism spectrum disorders. Those with PDD-NOS have difficulties in areas of social interaction and communication.
While I am high-functioning, my life has been full of enormous ups and downs. There were moments when I didn't think I was going to succeed. But I fortunately prevailed through many challenges, such as getting my driver's license, making friends, moving to a new home, starting college and writing a book.
Would I have met these goals by myself? No way. I did at times make the mistake of relying on my own understanding, but when I turned to other resources, including my parents, teachers and peers, I gained the wisdom I needed to accomplish the goals I was striving for.
