    <div class="stories">
      <p class="one"> The start of my story began at 12. I moved my whole life 7 hours away from the place called home. It was the last term of year 7 and I was the odd kid out. Everyone already had constructed their friend groups and I was just finding a place to sit at lunch time so I didn't look alone, I had a group but I didn't really have any close friends. I didn't tell them how I was feeling or what was going on at home. I was also seeing a psychologist as my family had just gone through a 12 month long custody battle. A result of this was no longer having contact with my father, little did I know it wouldn't be another 5 years before I’d see him again. At home I was being physically, emotionally and sexually abused. Not to mention at my new school I was being called names and would have people throwing food at the back of my head on the bus. I didn't tell anyone about that either. It felt like I had no control over my life and like I didn't have a way out. I had no voice. The only aspect I could control was my behaviour and what I did in my day to day life, a big part of me was a pit of hopelessness and I felt like I couldn't escape this feeling, nor did I know that this feeling I had was depression and anxiety.
When I was 14 exercise became my best friend. I was always involved in team sports. The competitive edge inside me grew and I became an avid runner. Every afternoon when I would get home from school running was my escape. It started at a few kilometres and eventually graduated up to multiple kilometres a day. I became obsessed and wouldn't miss my daily ‘escape’. Another thing that followed this obsession was how I fuelled myself. I began restricting my intake of food and adopting extreme dieting in order to ‘stay fit’. No one saw what was going on, asides from my GP. My menstruation had stopped. She encouraged me to see a therapist much to my mothers protest as ‘It was all in my head’ and ‘ I’d get over it’. Every Tuesday afternoon after school I’d see my therapist and sit there listening to her trying to get me to bring down my walls which wouldn't budge.
At 15 I hit my worst point. I was frequently falling asleep in classes, I couldn't concentrate and many of my teachers were ‘worried’. And so were a few of my friends I had at this time. I would still run every afternoon even though I felt so weak and was in so much pain, I’d also constantly experience blackouts and dizziness. One night I woke up and had severe chest pains and it felt like I was having a heart attack. I remember waking up in the emergency department attached to an ECG. This point for me was a wakeup call. I needed to change before I wouldn't be here anymore. I was referred to another psychologist specialising in adolescents and I opened up to one of my teachers at school who helped me regain healthier habits of eating and exercising. It wasn’t until I discovered strength training that I gained a voice for myself.
I left home at 16 and focused on my mantra “this is making you stronger, you are strong.” Don’t give up on searching for hope, there are people out there willing to help and not every psychologist, psychiatrist, councillor might be the right fit for you but don't give up on the search for the one who will really help to change your life. Believe in yourself too, You have the right to speak even if your voice shakes.</p>

<p class="one"> “Would you like some chocolate?” Three years ago, I would’ve been anxiously tapping my foot, my mind swarmed with calculations on “how many calories are in that?” Today, I eat for pleasure; to nourish my body with all the right foods that are a fuel to my brain; I am a fully-functioning human, actively involved in mental health work. I’ve battled anorexia and bulimia for nine years of my life. It’s not been a linear trajectory, often filled with roller coaster ups and downs. I’ve had a fair share of experiences with psychologists, psychiatrists, dieticians, cardiologists, GPs through therapy, group programs, hospitalisations—the list goes on.
Today, the pesky eating disorder voice occasionally creeps up. But I’ve learnt to turn up the volume of things in my life that matter most to me, and to notice those thoughts as temporary clouds-in-passing—and to not pay any attention to them. Importantly, I’ve learnt several key lessons along the way:
1) Keep persevering. It took my several tries before I clicked with the right clinician. When I did, it was immensely helpful to my recovery. I had relapses along the way. I began to lose hope in the entire process. Mostly I was filled with ambivalence, thinking that I was as “recovered” as I would get. Every time I challenged myself to something new, I became extremely uncomfortable; my eating disorder voice would ramp up, making daily activities exhausting. I was angry a lot for not being able to beat my eating disorder. But what I didn’t realise, was that recovery can take months and years before the internal battle would subside. Lapses and relapses didn’t mean I was back at Square 1; they gave me the opportunity to practice what I’d learnt in therapy, independently. I learnt something new each time; about a specific situation that triggered certain thoughts, or how effectively I used certain coping mechanisms. I had to keep persevering in being comfortable, so the uncomfortable became comfortable.
2) Learn to trust. It took me years to slowly start trusting in my treatment team, the process of recovery, and most importantly, myself. It took me years to trust that my treatment team were the experts in this area, that they were doing what was best for me. It didn’t seem like it, because they were going against my eating disorder’s wishes, not mine; and over time, I learnt to separate my identity from my eating disorder’s.
3) Know that you are healing. I found it incredibly challenging to reconcile with the fact I wasn’t seeing any other “tangible changes apart from weight gain”. For a long time, I’d cry everyday, not knowing why. I’d ask my therapist, “why can’t I stop waterfalling?” She’d reply with, “that’s because you’re not sitting back, riding comfortably along with it - you’re actively fighting the illness.” So it’s not a sign of weakness, but a sign of immense strength and bravery.
I’ve learnt that each little step I chip away at, is a win—and as my therapist always said, we aim for progress, not perfection. </p>

<p class="one"> Laughing. Dancing. Sleeping. Exploring. Writing. Travelling. Eating. Working. Partying. Loving. Crying. Existing. Living. This list is one that I began when recovering from anorexia, that I resumed when suffering with bulimia and that I carry with me to this very day. It serves as a constant reminder of a life worth living and a recovery worth chasing. To some, the elements on this list might be considered banal, even boring. Working? Where’s the fun in that? But to me, each and every one of them is a reason for recovery. They are all things that I took for granted before my eating disorder journey but that I now consider with gratitude every single day.
It saddens me that I had to hit rock bottom before learning to view life with positivity, gratitude and a great big smile, but I am able to look back on my experience today and know that it made me a stronger person. I am not grateful for my eating disorder, but I am thankful for the position I am now in: to educate and inspire others, to bring attention to the destructive mental illnesses that are affecting more and more people and to turn a personal negative experience into a universal positive one.
Like so many, my story began long before I thought it did. I always thought I had a ‘normal’ relationship with food and my body but essentially, I always thought that I was the largest in my friend group, and made it a goal to eat less than the others. But it was never anything extreme. Little did I know that it wasn’t the behaviours that were a problem but the thought process behind them. My story took a turn halfway through my first year of university when I was told by my doctor that I had put on weight. A harmless comment that targeted all of my old insecurities resulted in me crying in front of the mirror, grabbing wildly at my body and wishing that I could just disappear. All of my perfectionist tendencies came into play as I flung myself wildly into weight loss culture.
Little by little, my behaviour became more extreme. My entire life revolved around food and yet I barely touched it. I planned all of my meals down to the tiniest calorie. I began cutting out entire food groups and exercised to the point of exhaustion. No matter how tired or ill I was, I powered through until I stopped feeling hunger or pain. I stopped feeling anything. I learned to purge. I got better at saying no, at hiding away, at avoiding people, at lying. I didn’t know how to stop. I became spiteful. I shouted. I cried. I even ran away from my house, too scared to face the dinner that had been so lovingly prepared.
Eventually, my old self cried out, lost in the eating disorder that had enveloped me. The eating disorder that was at once my best friend and my worst enemy. I saw, for one fleeting moment, everything that I had lost. My friends. My family. My smile. My enthusiasm. My hobbies. My passion for theatre and for writing. My life. I turned to the Internet, and found a whole community of brave people in the same position that had chosen to fight. I made appointments and visited clinics. Only then did I realise what a scary world I had entered. Recovery wasn’t easy, and unfortunately I had to get worse before I got better. While I was physically recovered, my mental state was at its very lowest and I soon turned to a different type of self-hatred.
It took me a while to realise it, and even longer to come to terms with it, but I had bulimia. Every day was a cycle of restrict, binge, purge, hate myself and restrict again. I went from entirely rejecting food to making it my only source of comfort and release. Just like people with anorexia, people with bulimia are not themselves. They become their eating disorder. They become secretive, isolated and depressed. They cancel plans to binge and purge. They spend money they don’t have on food they don’t keep down. They hoard and they steal. I felt stuck. I was sure there was no way out. An eating disorder had entirely consumed me. I had not been myself since the comment my doctor made. I pushed people away to the point of almost ruining relationships.
But I also made it to the other side. I learned who my true friends are. I learned that there is forgiveness and compassion in the world. I slowly learned not only to accept myself, but to love myself, exactly as I am. I learned that there is, surprisingly, always hope. And this is why I am sharing my story. To tell all of you out there who may be suffering that you are not alone. I have seen both sides of this awful spectrum and probably every stage that you can fit in between. But hey, I’m still here. I’m still smiling and I’m still fighting.
You are not alone. You are loved. You are important. You are not worthless. You are beautiful. You are strong. And you will beat this thing. I promise.  </p>
