      <p class="one"> My story begins when I was five and I was taken to my first ballet class. Even though my mother had to drag me there, I suddenly had found myself in a place where I didn't feel like I would be judged for not being like the other boys and wanting to play their stupid games. In fact, I was the only boy in the ballet class and I was totally free to be my femmy little self. I never really developed any lasting friendships with boys in school, and I always perceived myself as different than most of them. Throughout the rest of elementary school I would see other boys who would seem inexplicably similar to me, but we always strayed away from each other. I don't think we consciously recognized what we saw in each other or ourselves, but we knew the gay jokes told at recess were related to us and it was better to keep our heads low. It was only in ballet class or at home did I feel comfortable and myself.
I think my family assumed that I would be gay when I was growing up. Often when I was little I would put on my mother's lipstick or play dress up with my best friend. She would let me try on her dresses and we would perform made up plays for our mothers. My mom had worked at a gay bar when she was younger and had several gay friends so she never tried to make me behave in a gender-conforming way. However, I once asked Santa at the shopping mall for a "my size Barbie" so I could play and dress up like her and to this day my mother regrets never getting me one.
As I got older I started getting depressed in middle school. I think this had to do with several stressful home life issues, but also dealing with my sexuality. I had stopped expressing my feminine side and became very self-conscious of how different I was than most boys. I seemed only to fit in with the girls but I found myself distancing myself from them, probably because I perceived it as gay and therefore the most dreadful thing a middle school boy could be. I had even dropped out of dance classes. </p>
