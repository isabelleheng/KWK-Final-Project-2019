      <h3>LGBTQ+ is an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and more. Many people who are a part of this community have faced fear of truly embracing themselves due to the backlash they could possibly receive. The LGBTQ+ community is still considered taboo, but we hope to change that with this forum. Please feel free to share a story or read others’ down below!

      <p class="one"> A young gay Muslim in Pakistan shares his experiences of life in the staunchly conservative country with PinkNews.co.uk.
The ember in my heart might enunciate my feelings of being gay especially Gay Muslim. What is my crime being a Muslim? That I have likings towards boys and I want to spend my life with another guy?
Will a Muslim society ever provide rights to homosexuals? This perturbs me all the time. Homosexuality is often misunderstood by many Muslim societies. Although, Islam does not promote homosexuality at all. But “being gay does not mean Allah (God) hates you”. God is the creator of the whole universe, how could he hate his own creation?
A typical Muslim society does not even know what the word “gay” means? Let’s see it in a more specific aspect; in terms of a “Pakistani Muslim Society”. I am very sorry to say that Pakistanis, in fact most Pakistanis do not even know what “gay” means? It is often confused with transgender here in Pakistan. People normally call transgenders gay. I have seen many times, people in their 50’s say, “Look! A gay is coming, don’t go near him and the one who is walking by is  transgender.
Second misconception here is that people think if somebody is gay, then he is a sex-aholic. In reality it is not like that, I personally think being a gay is not all about sex. We gays don’t only run after sex. We have feelings, we have hearts; it hurts us when people make fun of us. We don’t want sex all the time; we want love, peace, a life partner to spend our lives with.
I want to tell my family about me. I am afraid they will disown me. I love my Mom and Dad so much; I can’t even think to degrade them in front of the whole society. I don’t want them to be boycotted by society. I will never like it if they are subjected to funny jokes in the social circle just because their son is gay.
You know what? Typical Pakistani parents want their son to complete studies, get a job and then get married and give them grandchildren with whom they can spend their retired life.
My heart is heavy with many woes. Every time my parents discuss my marriage in front of my brothers and sisters, I just have to smile, try to change topic or leave the room silently without letting them know about the hurricane in my mind and heart.
I can’t discuss boys with friends just like straight people discuss girls. I unwillingly have to discuss girls at school and college with fellows. I don’t want to be called emasculate by announcing ‘Hey guys! I am gay.’
Each time my straight friends make fun of gay guys, I am there with them, sad and silent. I can’t say anything to support gays. I don’t want to get humiliated in front of the whole crowd and then maybe the whole college.
I am not envious of my fellow gay brothers living in an entirely different scenario from mine. They have freedom of expression, I don’t. They are open to their family and friends, I can’t even think to do so.
A John says to his father, “Hey Dad, I am going on date with my friend this valentine.”
And an Ali can’t even think to tell his father that he likes boys. </p>

      <p class="one"> 16-year-old Olly Hudson writes for PinkNews.co.uk about his experiences of being gay at a private all boys boarding school in the UK. He despairs at the homophobic environment and the lack of acknowledgement by the school that homosexuality even exists.
My name’s Olly, and I’m a 16-year-old from South Wales. I’m also gay. I decided to write this, mainly because I feel it’s time for someone of my background, to speak up for a whole swathe of the young gay population, who right now, are effectively ignored and left to fend for themselves by the mainstream media, and the environment in which they grow up.
I’m talking about being middle class. I’m talking about going to an independent day/boarding boys’ school, and I’m trying to get across to those who’ll listen, what it means to try and grow up in an environment where, perhaps, the most active and healthy part of any young person’s life, their sexuality, is repressed, ridiculed, though for the most part, willfully ignored by teachers and adults in positions of authority around them.
I haven’t always been a student at a private school, which for now will remain nameless. Until the age of 13, I, like most people, went to a comprehensive school. There, I was most comfortable and indeed spent most of my time in the company of girls. A seeming failure to ever really integrate and become ‘one of the boys’ was I’d admit, the main driving factor behind my decision to leave the school. When I reflect upon it, I wouldn’t have made the same decision to leave, had I my time again, though having not fully come to terms with my sexuality by the age of 13, this would never have played into any decision at the time. But leave I did, and I ended up in an all boys’ school. Again, probably not the most sensible decision on reflection, though that’s something that, really, I’ve realised more recently, as I finally accepted my sexuality, and came out to my closest friends.
I suppose, I wrote this too, to try and dispel a common-held ‘urban myth’ regarding boys’ schools, and boarding schools in particular. Generally, they’re seen as hives of latent homosexuality, places where boys, frustrated only in the company of other boys, inevitably turn to one another to experiment sexually, gay or not. It’s something widely caricatured in popular culture, though is let me assure you, a load of nonsense. </p>

      <p class="one"> Gay couples married out of state will now be able to have their marriages recognised in the state of Oregon, where equal marriage is still banned.
Oregon’s Chief Operating Officer Michael Jordan issued a memo this week saying that all state agencies must recognise the marriages of same-sex couples married out of state, despite that Oregon still does not allow them to take place there.
“Oregon agencies must recognize all out-of-state marriages for the purposes of administering state programs,” the memo read. “That includes legal, same sex marriages performed in other states and countries.”
The decision by the COO was based on a decision by the Oregon Department of Justice, which required the state to recognise all marriages performed elsewhere.
The ban on equal marriage in Oregon is being challenged by a 2014 initiative to have it put to a ballot, as well as a federal lawsuit. Two Portland couples filed a lawsuit in US District Court on Tuesday challenging the equal marriage ban. </p>
