      <p class="one"> Depression doesn’t leave scars, not always. And it’s hard to say how bad it is if you can’t see the wound.
If you know someone who’s going through a difficult time, if you have even the slightest doubt, reach out.
Even if you think it wouldn’t help, do it. Even if you think bringing it up could make it worse, or that it wouldn’t make a difference at all, even if it makes you uncomfortable, do it.
They don’t need much from you.
First, understand that their state of mind, the place they’re in, is on a different dimension. Depression is not just an extreme version of the sadness that you know, it’s sadness on a whole other dimension, one that is comparable and yet is entirely different, so different you can’t even begin to imagine it.
So, let me tell you what you can’t see. You can’t see they’re numb inside when they laugh at your jokes, that they haven’t eaten in three days, that they wish they won’t wake up when they go to bed every night.
It is important that you do see it, that you at least show that you want to. Because that person needs you. They need someone, anyone, to tell them it’ll get better. They might get through it alone, they’re strong, no doubt. They’ll talk themselves out of harming themselves, cry themselves to sleep, drag themselves to get help, and convince themselves to keep going another day. And they just might. But maybe they won’t. The illness bends their mind, tells them to stop fighting, and convinces them there’s nothing left to fight for.
In those times, they will need you to say that it’s all a lie. That they deserve to see the other side of the darkness, and that you will sit by them till they no longer need to fight. That the little hope they have is real. That their dark thoughts are nothing more than chemical imbalances – it’s not them, just a temporary tarp covering their light, that a beautiful life is waiting for them at the other end, waiting for them to get through some more time. That it’ll be worth it. Say it over and over again. Till they believe it. And then say it again. </p>

<p class="one"> My son is 16. He is a beautiful, empathic, popular, funny, whip-smart, athletic young man. However, his depression and anxiety is less than beautiful. In fact it is ugly, and mean, and at times relentless. Some months ago my beautiful son, decided that he had had enough of the silent, constant emotional pain that came with feeling less than he felt he should be. Ironically his suicidal thoughts snuck up after a soccer match where he had scored 3 goals  - and led his team to victory.
I guess I can forgive myself now for assuming that he might have been feeling positive, feeling that for once he was enough. How wrong we were. After the match, my son went into his room, and shut the door. He skipped dinner, which was not unusual, however his increasing level of agitation was something I had never witnessed before. My child was restless, angry, and sullen. The pain and desperation in his eyes was something that I will never forget. It was vastly distressing to watch at the time, and even now, as I type, I feel immense sadness.
As the behaviours escalated, we began to realise that our child needed immediate assistance from a health professional. As I sat with our beautiful boy, talking calmly and quietly, my husband went into another room and called a psychiatrist who gave us CAT team details. Our son spoke also with the psychiatrist, who confirmed with us that his depression had really ‘kicked in’.
Will had recently been prescribed medication, and his psychiatrist told us that for this particular crisis, we should increase it to a level where he might feel sedation or calm. We thought about the logistics of driving our son to the hospital, but we were not sure that one of us alone could get him there safely, we have other younger children that we couldn’t leave at home, nor did we want to bring them and expose them to the distressing behaviour of their brother. We removed all his electronic devices with Internet access, and hid anything that we thought he could use to harm himself.
That night as I continued to talk quietly to him; I reassured him that if the pain got too bad we always have options, we could take him to hospital, or we could organise an emergency ‘at home assessment’. I told him the story of how we had loved him even before he was born, and that we loved him now, more than he could ever imagine. Fortunately he fell asleep as we talked, and I lay on the floor at the end of his bed until sunrise.
Will continues to see a therapist, and although he still has some rough patches, he is getting better each day. I think as parents, we are forever altered by the experience; we practice self-care, and are learning to be kind on ourselves, and our parenting limitations or abilities. </p>

<p class="one"> Here's a piece of information which might make one or two recoil in shock. For the most part you couldn't spot a depressive from any other member of society; you might need to get very close to someone before it became apparent.Sadly getting close to someone for long enough for them to realise that periods of depressive illness are not something the sufferer has any control over, Close enough to realise that the sufferer is not trying to make them feel uncomfortable and that the behaviour they are subject to is not a personal attack on them is extremely difficult.
Those of you, who glanced over my previous blog on gaining employment as a sufferer of mental illness, will be aware of the dilemma we face when approaching an employer first up. Do I or don't I divulge the nature and extent of my illness? Well for the purposes of this blog, for employer read partner.
If finding employment is tricky (and that's something of an understatement) becoming involved in a long term relationship and hanging on to it is a task of mammoth proportions. There you are on the crest of a wave, enjoying an extended period of good mental health, you meet someone, and you like them, they like you, hell you may even have fallen in love. You've thought about your situation at some length and you have decided honesty is the best policy. It's what all female oriented magazines say when you've browsed through them in the doctors' waiting room, what all the Sunday magazines tell you, what all the agony aunts recommend. Women like honesty, they respect honesty and openness and will give you credit for sharing something about yourself. Well that might be the case for some women, but guys don't count on it. I'm sure men are the same, no in fact they are probably worse ;( most men think a woman who calls the day following a date is slightly obsessive and possessive!) But my experiences with women so that's the perspective I have.
A while back, I met someone, she was fantastic, and we dated and fell in love very, very quickly. It was a whirlwind but I found the time before it all took off and got out of control to tell her of my illness. She was very understanding and in spite of my doubts about whether or not she would be as understanding if, and I suspected when, the depression returned I carried on enjoying the moment, the feeling of having someone there who loved and understood me. This continued for about six months after four months I moved in with her, gave up my flat and threw my all into the relationship. Then one Friday night it all came to a head, I had been feeling a little low (I thought) and my partner challenged me about the way I had been behaving, I tried to explain that this is part and parcel of the condition but the atmosphere remained tense and turned into a full blown argument the following morning. We patched things up but from then on things were never the same again. This situation culminated in her telling me she needed some space and asked me to move out. My head just closed down. I thought it was all over and in my depressed and confused state I took an overdose with alcohol (which I never touch) I was taken to hospital and had my stomach pumped. On discharge I stayed with my parents and though we tried to make another go of the relationship, ultimately my partner could not deal with the prospect of this occurring again.
I was left shattered and as low as I have ever been, I'm still not sure I will ever trust anyone properly ever again which means that I may never properly love again and that's a thought which would drive the so-called “sane" to madness. This experience has certainly made me question being so honest and open about my illness, although working with TTC a little has made my illness a good deal less of a secret. Which I am choosing to see as a good thing, if people know from the outset what they are taking on then perhaps they will more carefully consider engaging with me in the first place.
