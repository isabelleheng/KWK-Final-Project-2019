      <p class="one"> "I knew I was bisexual when I wanted to date my best friend in high school. I still liked boys, but I knew I liked her, too. I actually didn’t know I was bi then because I didn’t know what bisexual even meant. I thought I was a total freak.
"In college, I had sex with a woman for the first time after a frat party. It wasn’t awkward or weird. We were both very chill about it the next day. I knew I wanted to see where this adventure would take me.
"As of now, I’m in a poly relationship with a man and a woman. It’s a lot of work, but I’m very happy." — Lilly, 31

"I truly realized I was bisexual at the end of my junior year of high school. Heteronormativity made me think I only liked guys for so long, and then I met this girl and I just realized I had never felt that way about any guy I had been with.
"I ended up dating that girl for a bit but also treated parts of senior year as most people (stereotypically) treat their freshman year of college—I explored a lot. It was freeing. It’s now nearly six years later, and while I’m in a committed relationship with a girl I've love for almost two years, I still identify as bisexual. I think that’s a major misconception, that your relationship status dictates your identity." —Ilana, 22

"My journey in understanding my sexuality began in high school when I had a dream about being with a woman, and I found that I enjoyed this dream a bit too much. From there, I explored my sexuality, dating both males and females.
"During college, I lost my desire for men and dove head first into the lesbian lifestyle for about four or five years. I joined a lesbian sorority and was deeply involved in the LGBTQ lifestyle and community in Atlanta.
"Around 2010, I found my attraction to men had been rekindled, but my love for women hadn't waned. My life in the lesbian community had become a large part of my identity, so I struggled reconciling my sexuality for a while, but in due time, I returned to my original identity from when I first explored my sexual orientation: I love people. Male and female, one at a time—I love people. But technically, I'm bi." —Cat, 35 </p>
