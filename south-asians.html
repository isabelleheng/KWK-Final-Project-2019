      <p class="one"> During my time on dating apps in Birmingham, I pretty much felt invisible. I sensed I was getting fewer matches because of my skin colour, but I had no way of checking that with the people who swiped left. As anyone who has grown up brown in the UK knows, you develop a sensitivity to racism (however blunt) and how your race impacts the way people treat you. Just last week a friend told me they spoke to a guy who, brown himself, said: "I don't really like brown girls, I think they're ugly." I was 11 the first time I heard a person I fancied say this.
But, as is so often the case, these are anecdotal experiences. How ethnicity and race feed into dating and online dating in the UK seems to be an under-researched field. That makes people of colour's experiences – of implicit and more explicit racism – difficult to talk about as fact, since they're rarely reported on. You may have read about how, in 2014, OkCupid analysed racial preferences from their users in the US and found a bias against black women and Asian men from nearly all races. Similarly, Are You Interested laid bare the race preferences on their dating app: once again, black people received the fewest replies to their messages. Though this data was pulled from users in the US, you could reasonably expect to find something similar in another majority-white country like the UK. </p>
