      <p class="one"> Vivek was born and brought up in Dubai for nearly 13 year until his family settled in Vadodra, India. He was around 8 years old when he felt there was something different about him than others. He knew he didn’t fit in the norms of the society. Since he was merely a kid he couldn’t understand what made him stand out.
It wasn’t easy for him to confess that he is asexual. He had several hurdles while breaking the societal norms. People didn’t readily understand that he didn’t have any sexual interest towards anyone. He was scared of being judged due to the stereotypical thoughts of the society.
There was always a fear of being misunderstood by the society and thinking about the tough life ahead once I spoke about who I was so I never came out with this secret for a long time. All these years I’ve been judged a lot by society. People have thought of me as something different on the basis of my behavior, talking and walking style.
He has been misunderstood to be a gay and it was difficult for him to explain himself to the ignorant people. The lack of sexual attraction was something new to people and they couldn’t understand it.
They have thought of me as gay and in return I could never explain my side to them. But a few years back I broke my silence and told my family and few close friends about my identity, that I’m asexual. I’m not interested sexually in any gender
Different people had different hypothesis about him and as he narrates,
At first my family called it a hormonal change of my teenage years and that I am normal otherwise. But I’d explain them that no this is me and you have to accept me as I am. They weren’t ready to accept me and were in deep shock but as time passed they have come to terms with it.
He explains that our progressive society doesn’t identify or acknowledge his personal space. It is intolerable for them to discuss asexuality or even accept that something like this could exist. While the mainstream society refuses to accept him, Vivek narrates,
Our LGBTQ community has been of a huge help when it comes to understanding and relating to my problems. I want our community to get recognised by the society. Once recognized, no one will question us or our identity.
Vivek understands that while LGBT, queers have got some awareness asexuality lacks such awareness.
Our society simply lacks such information and that has made them very closed minded when it comes to discussing such topics.
We salute your #BraveSpirit, Vivek for coming out of the closet and spreading awareness about asexuality. As he rightly said, not many would know about it and hence creating awareness becomes important. </p>

      <p class="one"> There's no doubt about it – we live in a highly sexualised society. Physical attraction is an important talking point, especially growing up, and if you're not discussing crushes and pulls, you can be viewed with suspicion. But a growing movement is coming out publicly to say "No, we aren't wired the same way as you – and that's just fine by us". Simone, 29, is part of that movement and she agreed to tellCosmopolitan UK exactly what it all means.
"Someone who is asexual doesn't experience sexual attraction," she explains. "In terms of sex drive, it varies from person to person, so a lot of asexuals say they don't have any kind of drive, whereas others say they have but it's like being hungry yet not wanting to eat any particular food." Simone has never had sex, but has been in relationships. "I have had brief relationships in the past but I felt like it wasn't really for me. I would say, however, that I'm a minority amongst asexuals – most of my asexual friends are in relationships." So, how does that work? "We tend to say in the asexual community people have romantic orientations despite not having a sexual one. People talk about being hetero-romantic, bi-romantic, homo-romantic etc. Others call themselves aromantic, meaning they're not romantically attracted to anyone. I would put myself in the last category."
Simone's former partners have been accepting of her lack of sexual interest – but not everyone was as understanding. "The people I've been in relationships with have been other people who've seemed happy not to have sex, although I wouldn't necessarily call them asexual," she says. "In my early 20s I had quite a few initial dates that didn't go anywhere because of the fact I wasn't interested in sex. I was still slightly in denial about being asexual at that point, though. I still thought it was something I could change or just get over somehow."
"I wouldn't say being asexual has been a barrier, as I'm quite happy being single," she continues. "I would consider being in another relationship in the future, but whether or not that would look like a stereotypical relationship to other people I'm not sure, because I'm really not a physical person at all. This isn't common to all asexuals. A lot like kissing and cuddling and other romantic affectionate physical gestures."
So, what would a relationship look like to her? "If I was in a relationship it would be more about security and practicality!" she explains. "And it would have to be with someone who was on the same page. I wouldn't want to be depriving anyone of what they considered a full relationship, so I'm aware that my dating pool is small."
Simone realised she was a little different when she was at secondary school. "I went to an all-girls school and there was an all-boys school next door," she recalls. "We were taught separately but at break and lunch times we were allowed to mingle. As I got to 12 or 13 I noticed that a lot of girls my age seemed really obsessed with going out and talking to the boys and I didn't really get why. This sounds terrible, but it was a bit like watching a documentary. I was really interested but I had no idea what was going on. I thought it might all click for me at some point but it never did."
In desperation, Simone turned to her mother for advice. "I asked 'Why do people pretend to enjoy all this?' and she said 'Oh, people don't pretend to enjoy it – you can have a bad date but most of the time people enjoy dating'. That struck me as really strange." Eventually Simone began to question whether she might be gay. "But when I thought about it," she says, "I realised the idea of doing anything sexual with a woman didn't appeal to me either. I had no word to describe what I was feeling – or not feeling."
At 18, in her first year of university, Simone finally discovered the term "asexual" and the asexual community. "When I first told my parents they weren't surprised," she laughs. "They were worried, though, that if I adopted the 'asexual' label I'd somehow cut myself off. That if I said 'This is me' and called myself asexual for the rest of my life, I'd never have a relationship in the way that most people do. To them it was all a bit too concrete and final. But that was 10 years ago. Now, they're really supportive of the asexual community. It's just taken them a while to realise what it means."
"You never hear straight people being asked if they might change their minds," Simone concludes. "It's only the rest of us (asexual, LGBTQ+, etc) who get asked. I don't have a crystal ball. Things may well change for me in the future, but I think it would be really great if people could accept that this thing exists." Simone is keen to stress that, although it is now being talked about more, asexuality isn't a youth 'fad'. "We're not all young people who've read this on the internet and attached ourselves to it. There are older people who've gone through their lives wondering what's wrong with them and then found our community and suddenly it makes sense."
Asexuality has left Simone starkly aware of how oppressive some traditional concepts of womanhood really are. "There's definitely this societal expectation for women to be (or want to be) 'sexy'," she explains. "For a long time I felt subject to the same pressures, even after coming out as asexual, because to some extent your own sexual orientation becomes irrelevant. It's about you as an object to be looked at. It was feminism much more than asexuality that gave me the knowledge to unpick these expectations.
"The pressure on women to be sexually attractive goes far beyond the dating world. Just look at the recent debates over whether workplaces can force women to wear high heels as part of a dress code. It's something that has to change." Amen. </p>
