      <p class="one"> I didn’t become ambitious until I was in my 40s, when I started to look at the men who were running the agencies and said, “I think I could do better—I’m going to go for it.” Interestingly, I did it all within the halls of Ogilvy, which says a lot about the organization and the opportunities it gives women. I finally got the corner office a year and a half ago, after 15 years as a managing director. There are a lot of women in the advertising industry, but there aren’t as many running an office in the Ogilvy network (which is in 155 countries), so I’m pretty proud of that. And here in Toronto, I can name at least four other women running agencies, which says a lot about Canada’s commitment to diversity and gender equality.
I haven’t been the victim of overt physical or sexual harassment, but the sexism—yes. And those entrenched stereotypes and the resulting behaviours have made me angry.
Early in my career, I had a boss who would have me do all the work and then present it as his own at meetings, where I would be relegated to changing slides in the projector. It was shockingly bad behaviour. Or if I was dealing with a particularly cantankerous client, the guys around the office—my peers and bosses—would say, “Oh, the reason you get along with him is because he really wants to get in your pants.” And that’s not right. That’s inappropriate. I had a couple of women who stood up for me, and that helped me develop the courage to stand up for myself.
But just last week, I was giving a personal history, and the interviewer asked what I did. I told him I worked in advertising, and this guy looked at me and said, “Oh, in admin?” And I went, “No—actually, I run the joint.” In 2018, this is happening.
I’m a “don’t get angry, get even” person. Now, I coach women on how to behave in the boardroom to elevate their status and overcome bias, to take a position of power at the table. For instance, I tell them not to be afraid to get up and move around—it indicates confidence, instead of sitting hunkered down, checking your notes. Speak early and often, because it establishes that you’re part of the group. And use first names—it speaks to a certain authority and confidence that seems to work in the boardroom.
We also need to give women permission to be ambitious. If we start to be too aggressive in our asks, if we get very pointed in our discussions, we come off as being bitchy. A guy comes off as being assertive.
Here at Ogilvy, they’ve created a robust female sponsorship program to help women drive their aspirations and make connections. But our industry also has the power to make change happen on a broader scale. Consider a campaign we just finished for Kimberly-Clark’s Kotex brand. It’s all about exposing stereotypes attached to women who are on their period—that they’re irrational. Women are responding to it, and the campaign is winning awards in both Canada and the U.S., because it’s revealing a stigma women have to endure in the workplace. </p>

<p class="one"> I have more than 30 years of experience in the mining industry. As a geoscientist, I’ve lived and worked at mining sites all over the world, including northern Canada, Mongolia, Ghana, Senegal, Romania and South America.
My first job out of university was at a mine in Timmins, Ontario. For three months, the mine manager wouldn’t even let me go underground. When a new chief geologist came in and insisted I be allowed to go underground, the walls of the office I shared with the samplers were suddenly papered with pornography. I would take them down, and they’d come up again. I tried to talk to the guys about it, and finally one of them threatened me—if I ever touched those pictures again, they were going to put my hand in the rock crusher and break all my fingers. It was very intimidating, and my manager already didn’t want a woman at the site, so there was no support. But I’m stubborn, and I wasn’t going to let them chase me away.
Remote mine sites can be some of the most challenging. You’re so outnumbered, with everybody watching and commenting on every aspect of what you do. As a woman, you’re aware of where everyone is—just vigilant, constantly. It wears you down.
I once spent two months at a camp in Ghana with 100 to 150 men. There was not another woman in the whole camp. And the room they gave me was outside the main compound, exposed to the road. Every morning, 300 fieldworkers would gather outside my door to get their assignments for the day. I had no solid curtains, and it felt very uncomfortable. Just walking into the eating area—there was no welcome. If I sat down, they moved away. It was very isolating.
I also spent a year in Venezuela with a crew of diamond drillers, which is a highly masculinized industry. They’d talk about the way they were treating women in the community, and it was horrifying to have no power—or what I perceived as no power. There were local women, typically from very poor communities, who thought they were in “serious” relationships with drillers. They would turn up at the site to find out their “boyfriend” had gone back to Canada. The drillers had no regard for them as human beings.
I’ve talked to some men about difficult situations they’ve observed where they didn’t know what to do. We need to encourage men to overcome the discomfort associated with speaking out. Yet most of the companies I dealt with at the time were Canadian, using Canadian drillers. And I’d have conversations with management about the culture that was allowed to develop at these sites and to offer more education. But I hear from other female geologists that not much has changed. It’s great that organizations and companies are trying to get more women interested in the mining industry, but until we change the culture, my feeling is they’re not going to stay.
That was one of my motivations for starting the Me Too Mining Association. I’ve seen what I call the cult of personality in a lot of mining companies, where the CEO is very aggressive or a bully and the women just tend to leave. It’s a small industry, and there are already so few women in it. And the mentality is that if you stick your head up, it’s going to get chopped off. </p>
