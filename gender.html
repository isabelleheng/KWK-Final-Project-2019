      <h3>Gender has always been defined as either male or female. You would always just have the set status as soon as you were born. However, gender identity has been broadened over the years allowing for more and more people to express themselves. Many parents still raise their kids to fit gender norms,  but people are still breaking out of the mold to express their true identity. Feel free to express your identity down below where you will not be judged in any way.

      <p class="one"> My friends always looked at me strange when I went into the boys section or girls section in the clothes shop.
“But you’re Agender! You can’t wear girls clothes!”
“I thought you didn’t identify as male?”
I don’t, but if I don’t take clothes from one part of a clothes store, what the hell am I meant to wear?
Clothes don’t HAVE genders. They’re inanimate objects like a stone or a clock. Just because I wear a skirt does not make me a girl. Just because I wear shirts from Topman does not make me a dude.
I’m a human being, but my clothes aren’t. So just let me wear what I want, OK?
 </p>

 <p class="one"> It can feel like an island at times that no one understands or can even imagine what it’s like to be in our shoes. I have experienced a number of emotions. Denial, grief, affirmation, fear, and yes even anger.
My extended family is really struggling with the news of my child’s Transition. They feel “he” is too young and that we are ruining “his” life. My child’s grandparents say he is a “Boy treat him as a Boy” You are the parent you must guide him. I grew up in a Catholic Military family. I have been accused of wanting a girl and encouraging this and indulging her every whim and fetish.
It’s so hard to deal with ignorance and with personal attacks on my parenting when I want to affirm my child’s identity. This has been a 3 1/2 year journey with my child being insistent, persistent, and consistent and finally her parents listening and affirming what she has always known. Since she could talk she knew she was a Girl. I look forward to the day when what is between our legs does not matte </p>
