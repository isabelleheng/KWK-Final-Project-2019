      <p class="one"> Gracin has down syndrome. He  turned 3 in June, and for the first time I realized he is not a baby anymore.  I was struggling with the idea of letting him go to pre-school.  I thought – my little guy is not walking or talking…how could he possibly go to school?  After weighing the pros and cons, my husband and I finally came to the conclusion that we wanted Gracin to go to school in a regular classroom.  Shortly after we made our decision, he started walking!  Even though he conquered waking, I still worried that the teachers wouldn’t know when he was hungry or sad or when he needed something since he wasn’t able to communicate with words.
	My worries were still there on August 19th when the van came to pick him for his first day of school.  To my surprise, he practically ran out the door to begin his new journey!  I stood on the front porch crying happy tears as he yells his version of “bye” from inside the van.  It has been a few months since school started, and it is going so well. Gracin actually has five new words and a sparkle in his eye that I have never seen before.  Despite my fears, sending him to pre-school was the best decision we could have made. Just remember, our children are unstoppable…we can’t be what stands in their way!</p>

      <p class="one"> After marrying my beautiful wife Allison nearly two years ago, my life was complete, but we felt something was missing.  We both brought two kids each into this marriage, myself: Joshua (Age 10) and Alexis (Age 7), and her: Zach (Age 11) and Jacob (Age 9).  But we felt that having a child of our own would only complete our family more.  So, we decided to try and have our own child, and on the morning of February 14th, 2014, the Lord blessed us with a healthy 8 lb. 11oz. baby boy.  As the delivery doctor escorted me out of the room while in route to go get the grandparents, he had asked me if we had any fetal testing done during her pregnancy.  I had told him no, as we had known that no tests would have changed our thought process on whether we would have a child or not.  He then proceeded to tell me that by looking at the first tell-tale signs, that our newborn son appears to have Down Syndrome.  I was blind-sided!  What now?  Nothing had prepared me for raising a child with special needs, or a so-called “disability.”  I just knew my wife would be devastated….. After sometime, the pediatrician came in asked the family to exit, I sat there and watched as my wife had to go through the roller coaster of emotions as the doctor gave her the preliminary diagnosis of Trisomy 21 she believed our newborn son to have.
Once the crying ended, I assured her there was a purpose for this baby.  We wholeheartedly believe that our Lord and Savior gave us this beautiful baby boy to touch the lives of so many.  And that HE HAS!!!  Almost 8 months later and Luke Mitchell Day is as healthy and happy as any baby anyone could ever imagine.  He was blessed to not have to undergo any heart surgeries, as we went to our last cardiologist visit on September 26th, 2014 and had the echocardiogram to ensure all was well.  He is the happiest baby I have ever encountered, and even after the worst of days at work, I can come home and see that smile of his and know there is so much more to this life.  His siblings are constantly interacting with him, making him giggle and playing with him.   He has touched so many lives already, and will continue to be such a positive influence in our community.  We are truly fortunate to be his parents, and I don’t know that I would want it any other way.  Luke Mitchell Day, our little blessing!!!  </p>
