      <h3>Disabilities are considered physical and mental conditions that can limit someone’s movements, senses, or activities. However, they do not have to limit someone’s whole life. Disabilities can affect one’s vision, movement, thinking, and many more areas. People with disabilities, even if they are the same, can be affected in different ways from each other. Everyone has a different experience, but please feel free to share yours down below.

      <p class="one"> With my brother who is both mentally and physically disabled we were able to get him set up with disability income and assisted living.
My grandmother raised him and unfortunately due to some health issues she needed to start taking it easy and just won’t be able to look after him anymore.
He was on a wait list for 4 years so it’s something you want to set up ahead of time, but he is now set for life. The one my brother is in has full support for them and regular activities to keep them busy and social.</p>

      <p class="one"> My wife and I are really struggling with the concept of how our kids will survive without us. We're at a point where even dying of old age is a possibility and our children are the kind of disabled where they can easily be abused and taken advantage of. Neither of us have extended family and we're at a loss as to how to proceed, so I am looking for some inspiration. The best we came up with was the hire a large law firm, the too big to fail kind, and set up a trust fund through them with someone who manages it and pays monthly for services for the kids so there's always people around. </p>
