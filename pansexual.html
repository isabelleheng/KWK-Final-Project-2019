    <p class="one"> What can you tell us about being pansexual in Portugal?
In Portugal, like in most places in the world, you are educated to like girls or boys. There is a binary system, you always need to check one box or the other, you can’t be a mystery, something in between both. People don’t understand what liking a person is like, because they are educated to like a gender. Some people joke around ignorantly and say if pansexual people can fall in love with absolutely anyone, they can probably fall in love with anything too, like animals for example. I tend to be someone who is very direct, I am not afraid of speaking out, so I can get a lot of hate sometimes. I think transparency is the first step to changing society.</p>

    <p class="one"> Did you come out to your family?
I was about to get married to a man, and then I started to have feelings for a woman, and I chose her over him, and had a 7 year relationship with her. At the beginning, I didn’t tell my family who she was, but I brought her to many family events, without ever mentioning we were together. At the beginning, they felt strange, but there is a famous saying in Portuguese: ‘Primeiro estranha-se. Depois entranha-se’, which means “first its strange, but then you become familiar”, so I think that by the time I wanted to tell them who she was, they had already figured it out.
My mom had a harder time accepting it, but with time she got to know my girlfriend, and really appreciating her, and that helped. My sister had no problem with it. As for my nephews, maybe they found it a little strange that their aunt was with a woman when they were kids, but they were so little that it was very easy to explain. I know there are families with far worse problems than mine. Now, my grandmother is always poking harmless fun at me, asking if this time I’m going to fall in love with a boy or a girl. I tell her I love ‘people’, and now she understands.
 My family just wants to see me happy. For me it’s important that whoever is in my life is also in theirs. I feel very privileged because I know many people have to run away from home to be who they are. It took many many years with my grandmother to try to make her understand, or not feel awkward about using the word ‘bi’, ‘homo’ or ‘pan’. In the end, she doesn’t want to know if I’m “this” or “that”. She’s 91 years old, all she wants is to see me happy.</p>

    <p class="one"> I realized I was pansexual when I was 20 years old. Up until college, I had not even considered the possibility that I was not straight. I walked home one night, after listening to a fellow student discuss her coming out story, and thought about my perceived sexuality. I thought of my boyfriend, abroad in Italy, and was confused what it would mean to no longer be his straight girlfriend — what if I was attracted to other genders, too? I had never thought much about it. I just assumed, because I liked guys up until that point, that I was straight.
When I was younger, I only found myself attracted to boys. And it made sense — any boy I befriended, older people made implied romantic comments about the relationship, encouraging it. So I thought that’s what happens — I date boys and will eventually marry a man. But that one student’s candidness about her sexuality truly made me reevaluate what I thought was a given.   What took me around two more years to realize fully is that it’s not that I was straight my whole life up until that point — it’s just that I had closed myself off to the idea of being anything other than that. This meant taking 20 years of heterosexual relationships as my only guide of romance — in media and almost all the people that I knew — and realizing, for me, it doesn’t have to be that way. It isn’t that way. I’m attracted to someone for who they are as a person, regardless of their gender.
The first person who wasn’t a cisgender guy that I was interested in was Ruby Rose, who identifies as genderfluid (though she uses she/her/hers pronouns). I know you’ve probably heard about the “straight” girl crushing on Ruby Rose before; don’t roll your eyes. When I watched season three of Orange is the New Black, I totally hopped aboard the Ruby Rose train. She was mysterious, sexy and of course had an accent. So while she didn’t in fact “make me gay,”she solidified what I suspected as my truth. My second non-male crush identifies as female and wasn’t a celebrity; she was someone I met through work. She perfected the art of conversation and had a glowing smile, and spending time with her felt safe and right.
What pansexuality means to me is my attraction to people isn’t based on their gender. I’m attracted to someone who’s ambitious, smart, dorky and caring. I like someone that challenges me, and forces me to defend my opinions and mind. I like someone I can easily laugh with, someone who will watch Netflix with me and unapologetically love One Direction as much as I do. And these characteristics can be found in any gender.
What’s especially fun and exciting as a pansexual person is how my attraction for different people and genders manifests. I find with people who aren’t male that I’m more at ease and immediately comforted — albeit still nervous when a cute barista says she likes my makeup. With men, there’s more of a guard up that I’ve got to work around. Getting around that can be worth it, though.
With the boyfriend I had in college, what worried me was our relationship would change due to my “new” sexuality. It was also confusing to reconcile that I discovered this part of me that recognizes attraction to other people. I was nervous to explain this to him, and aimed to be as clear as possible that my sexuality didn’t change the fact that I wanted to be with him. I knew he’d be supportive, but no matter how wonderful you think people will be when coming out, it’s still a huge thing to reveal and feeling anxious is definitely understood.
Questioning years of attraction toward one gender and questioning if you can be attracted to other genders is 100% OK, and definitely worth the journey of self-discovery. Now it has been three years since I realized I’m pansexual. I have come out to my friends and family; most of them responded with an outpouring of love. I’m unbelievably excited to continue vocalizing this part of my identity, embrace others joining the community with open arms and can’t wait to rock the hell out of NYC Pride.</p>

<p class="one"> It is just over a year ago that Janelle Monáe, “crying in her spacesuit,” came out as pansexual in a cover story for Rolling Stone.It was, as the article said, “something the world has long guessed, something her closest friends and family already know, something she’s long been loath to say in public.”
Now, all these months later, Monáe, beaming and unfiltered in a black-and-white mini-dress, a long, fanned ponytail, and the spirit of Pride Month, is reflecting on the power that being open and public about her sexual identity has had. And what she wants from us, too: A “beautiful future.”
She is into the idea of conversations, and journeys. She told Rolling Stone then, “Being a queer black woman in America, someone who has been in relationships with both men and women—I consider myself to be a free-ass motherfucker.” According to the magazine, she initially idenitifed as bisexual, “but then later I read about pansexuality and was like, ‘Oh, these are things that I identify with too.’ I’m open to learning more about who I am.”
The occasion for our sit-down is her partnership with Belvedere Vodka’s “Beautiful Future” campaign celebrating integrity, diversity, and self-expression, an apt message on the week of New York City’s annual Pride March. This year the city is also the location of WorldPride and pays tribute to the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. She’ll be in town, the second time the Dirty Computer artist will be celebrating Pride.
She flashes a mischievous grin when I ask her how her life has changed since coming out publicly, that kind of giggle-smile that everyone in her community is familiar with, the one that telegraphs: It’s a lot.
In her public life, the one that has her giving inspirational speeches at a Pride-themed vodka party, her candor about coming out with a pansexual identity that continues to mystify so many people—aggregated pickup of the Rolling Stone story almost uniformly included “what is pansexuality?” in the headlines—was celebrated.
In her private life, things were more complicated.
“When you’re in relationships, or when your family members are having to deal with, you know, your sexuality in a public space, it’s hard,” she says. “Some of them cling more to their religious beliefs. And I grew up in a Baptist family so I had to have multiple conversations with my family around what this means, being a bi-pan woman.”
She mimics their confusion. “They’re like, well, when you were in a relationship with him?... Well, how can you love her?… Or, weren’t you in a relationship with her but you love him? It's like, you know, sexuality is not a destination. It’s a journey. It’s a journey and I’m discovering things about myself all the time and I’m choosing to embrace it and not suppress it. And this is where I am. This is how I identify.”
She says that a big “coming out story” was something she never wanted to do. But it was necessary, even if she was rattled with anxiety in the weeks before the story was published. Her music and her art has always been autobiographical: her truth for public consumption, a collective healing. That was going to continue with the release of Dirty Computer in 2018, which, amidst a treasure trove of queer-positive content, included the song, “Don’t Judge Me,” and the pointed lyric, “Let the rumors be true.”
“The only way I know how to write is to be honest to where I am,” she says. “And I knew that there was going to be questions asked and I just needed to be prepared. So I had anxiety around having to talk about my work that is so honest to who I am.”
She gestures at me and gives a firm, certain nod. “But I’m happy I did it. And I’m happy that I didn’t allow my fear and anxiety to get in the way of my freedom.”
We share a moment, a beat of mutual understanding. She tells me something that, normally, I wouldn’t include in an article, except that it was coming from a place so seemingly earnest and heartfelt that I think it truly speaks to who she is, and how this last year has changed her. “I appreciate you,” she says. “We have to appreciate each other.”
When Monáe grips a dangling microphone in an art installation set up at The Shed at Hudson Yards for the night’s celebration, she jokes that she’s always been obsessed with the future. It’s a reference to the Belvedere campaign, sure, but also the motif that defined her first era as an artist, the android, the “alien from outer space/The cybergirl without a face” that not only defined her first decade of music, but also became her go-to response when questioned about her sexuality.
It’s a bit on-the-nose, but I ask her how she sees her future.
“I definitely see women holding more positions of power in politics and behind the scenes,” she says. “Not just in front of the camera when it comes to entertainment, but really producing, running film studios. I see us at that table on the forefront. I see a world where we are listening not to speak or respond, but we’re listening to each other to understand, to really empathize with what we’re going though.” </p>
