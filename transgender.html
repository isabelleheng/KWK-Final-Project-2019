      <p class="one"> Before I came out as transgender I was a shy reclusive person.
I didn’t have many friends and would never really go out unless it was with my family. I found it very difficult to interact socially, for example I couldn’t go out for a coffee on my own like everyone else does.
From about primary school age I knew that there was something wrong.
It was very difficult to make male friends as we just had nothing in common. And I couldn’t make female friends either because I always thought I’d be found out, or that they would find it strange.
I spent the first 36 years of my life trying to live how society had told me I should, as male, but I knew that I was female inside and this nearly destroyed me.

So one night, with nothing else to lose as I just couldn’t go on as I was or I would no longer be here, I blurted out to my wife Julie during an argument that I was a freak.
It sounds bad, but I was terrified and I thought that’s how the world was going to see me from now on. To my surprise – after many nights of shouting, screaming and nearly calling it quits on our marriage – Julie said that she would support me as she still loved me as I still love her.
We’d said in our vows “For richer for poorer, in sickness and in health” and those vows meant something to us both.

It was not that I didn’t want to be male before then, it was more that the world had consistently rejected my masculinity.
I always felt male.
I raged every time I was asked to wear something feminine for an event or family photo. I giggle when I see those pictures now as I think that, 30 minutes before that smiling moment with my sister and brothers, I was a nightmare.
When I was a child, the term for me was tomboy — and I would grow out of it. I look back and feel sad that the person I was was constantly rejected.
What I learned from my formative years was I was not good enough or of any significance. That behaviour created a lost young adult who never knew how to build a life for himself.
I fell in love and gave my all to partners with nothing being built for me. I couldn’t put words to what was missing.
When eventually I came out, I was attending University to retrain for office-based work. I found it amazingly supportive and non-judgemental as long as I was straight about what was going on.
I was really proud of that college.
It’s wonderful to share my story of being a trans woman and contribute to this series with a video done by my friend the filmmaker James Westby.
I was born in the 1950s in Milwaukee and transitioned at age 50. I had a difficult childhood due to feeling like I was a girl, not the boy I appeared to be. The first incident occurred at 4-½. I fell into a lake at my grandparents’ cottage. My mom rescued me and while my wet clothes were in the dryer I was put in the only dry child’s outfit available: my cousin’s dress. Wearing a dress was a revelation! I loved it. And then when I had to change back into my boy clothes, I was very upset and screamed.
Through the next four decades I struggled a lot with my gender dysphoria, often using drugs when I cross-dressed. I did marry a great woman and was married for 15 years, but in the end my desire to be a woman never left me. I finally got the courage to transition after my wife left the country to begin a new job (we divorced shortly thereafter). Transitioning was much tougher than I had expected. It wasn’t like when I was that innocent boy who wore a dress and felt liberated. It was a lot of work to overcome the many issues that had always held me back.
Today I look back to my transition and surgery and am so happy that I persevered. No more secrets, no more deception. I’m truly the gender I was meant to be. That means everything.

In January 2011, Mia Macy was told that she would be given a position in the laboratory at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). After revealing in March 2011 that she was in the process of transitioning her gender, she was told that the position was cut. Later in the year, she learned that it had been rewarded to someone else. On the grounds that the ATF was creating a hostile work environment, the Justice Department responded swiftly, declaring that the ATF should give her the job she was seeking along with financial backpay. </p>
