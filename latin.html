      <p class="one"> To be a Central American author is an oxymoron. To be a Central American writer is to be a writer from a region that is not only marginalized in relation to a metropolitan hegemonic center but even marginal to other marginal centers of cultural thought. It is a marginality within a marginality. That is why our voices often go unheard, as if we were mouthing words into emptiness, or producing signs to which very few attribute any relevance. The only exception to this uncanny situation has been when we speak in the name of a revolutionary political organization that has triumphed, or perhaps, carries the hope of a potential triumph. This happened in the 1980s. However, beginning with the 1990s, our voices returned to the realm of the forgettable, to that corner which does not have any influence, nor inserts itself within what could be considered the transcendental debates of our time. A clear example is the case of Rigoberta Menchú. The debate in the hegemonic centers has not necessarily been about Menchú as a person, nor even about her distinctiveness as a Mayan subject. The debates have been, rather, about academics in the globalized center that, using Menchú as a trope, try to advance their own theoretical positions as part of a power play taking place chiefly within U.S. academic centers. The truth of the matter, in large measure, is that very few of the protagonists of this debate are genuinely interested in the daily reality of the Maya, their women, their survivors, or even their pain and suffering. What they are truly concerned about are the professional benefits they could potentially enjoy as a result of their particular theorization of Menchú. </p>

      <p class="one"> When you look at the numbers of people coming to the United States from Central and South America, it’s easy to forget the personal stories.
Juan is a 15 year-old from Nuevo Progreso, Guatemala. He fled North with his family when a local gang threatened to kill his family after he refused to sell and smuggle drugs for them. They survived beatings and robberies along the journey and turned themselves in to US immigration authorities to apply for asylum.
They’re now in the United States, waiting to find out whether they will be allowed to stay. Reporter Brooke Binkowski went to visit them where they’re living right now in San Diego. </p>
