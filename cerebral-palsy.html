      <p class="one"> “I have mild spastic diplegia. My cerebral palsy (CP) made me the person I am today. It has shown me that there is strength in the weak and a world full of outsiders.
Since I grew up unaware of my CP diagnosis, my younger self was only conscious of the fact that my stiff muscles made it taxing for me to walk straight and for long distances, to wear certain shoes, and to participate in vigorous activities. I now realize that these difficulties were strongly magnified by the negative emotions they produced. Feeling as though I did not fit in and devoting energy to try to mask that very fact caused more pain than the tangible, physical aches. I did not fully understand why my body could not move the way most kids’ could, and my confusion only worsened my perception.
As a coping mechanism, I ignored my responsibilities to stretch my leg muscles. I hoped that if I didn’t acknowledge my complications, then maybe one day they would just evaporate. I am certain that I would not have increased flexibility in my muscles without my family’s support and their reminders to stretch. My mother took me to physical therapy sessions every week and my older brother, Christopher, helped make my assigned stretches become part of my routine. Christopher, an athlete, understood the benefits and rewards reaped from exercising and targeting particular muscles in order to strengthen them. He and I would watch television in our living room regularly; he would use the time to stretch and invited me to do so too. At the time, I felt as if my condition had already defeated me and, so, completing the stretches seemed pointless. But, for a long while, there in that living room alongside my older brother was the only setting where I felt comfortable doing my assigned stretches because it was the only place where I did not feel alone in my journey. Christopher gave me exactly what I needed then– the courage to work on myself. </p>

      <p class="one"> “Is this hopeless?” Cynthia Frisina Gray asked upon learning about her daughter’s diagnosis of cerebral palsy in 2001. Cynthia knew there was a possibility that Cathryn could have problems—she was born prematurely—but she never imagined the difficulties that lay ahead.
Though she seemed fine at first, after several months, Cynthia began to notice that sometimes Cathryn seemed very floppy, almost like a rag doll. Other times, she seemed to stiffen. “I knew she wasn’t hitting the same growth and motor milestones like my older daughter,” said Cynthia.
Several doctor’s appointments later, she finally received a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Cynthia immediately went to the Internet searching for anything and everything about cerebral palsy. She felt frustrated by the limited information she could find that specifically addressed the needs of parents.
Cynthia expressed her frustrations to Cathryn’s orthopedic surgeon, who connected Cynthia with another parent of a child with cerebral palsy: Anna Marie Champion. Cynthia and Anna Marie set out to understand how they could help educate other families about prevention and treatment. But they weren’t sure where to start. They read about spina bifida, a disabling birth defect of the spine, and about the discovery that folic acid can help reduce it. “That’s what we want—our ‘folic acid’—something that could help prevent cerebral palsy,” Cynthia said. “We found out that we can’t prevent and treat cerebral palsy without understanding the root causes of it.” Tracking the number of children with cerebral palsy is the first step to understanding the characteristics and finding the root causes.
“Watching Cathryn go through the pain of two major orthopedic surgeries at such a young age is hard, but we know it’s necessary to help her walk,” said Cynthia. Today, Cathryn is thriving but her mother knows there will be many challenges ahead. “Like all parents, I hope and dream about my daughter going to college and having a fulfilling life,” said Cynthia. “I also hope that one day we know what causes cerebral palsy so that we can help others.”
