      <p class="one"> Michael Wang, 22, is as brash and confident as one would expect from a person willing to be one of the few outspoken Asian American faces against affirmative action. “I think everyone can agree with me that this policy is outdated and old, and things need to be changed,” he told me one day this past May, at a dim sum parlor near the law firm where he works as a paralegal. Wang continued, “If you can’t agree with that, then you have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Michael’s father, Jeff, agrees. “It’s time we should talk about it, right?” He believes that the ways colleges consider race hurts Chinese Americans like his son. “Supposedly Chinese is [a] minority, and in the history we have been mistreated,” Jeff said. “We should be treated well, not punished.”
An only child, Michael, who lives with his parents and cousin in Union City, California, just one hour south of San Francisco, had been groomed to become a top student by his father, an education professional trained as a teacher in China. Michael had his sights set on Harvard since he was 8, when he first started hearing his parents and their friends throwing the school’s name around. “I already knew I had to do this; I had to build my résumé,” Michael said. While his friends would play video games after school, he practiced the piano or was tutored in math by his father. When Michael was in elementary school, Jeff persuaded the school district to let his son take math classes at the local middle school. He picked Michael up every day to drive him to the middle school; he did the same when Michael was in the seventh grade, dropping him off daily at the local high school for more advanced classes. He went on to skip the eighth grade.
But in 2013, Michael was rejected from the most elite colleges in the nation. In response, he filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education (ED), alleging that Princeton, Yale, and Stanford had refused him admission solely on the basis of his race. (He was, however, accepted by the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California, Berkeley, and Williams College; Harvard as well as Columbia wait-listed him before ultimately rejecting him.) In his complaint, he rattled off his accomplishments: He was the salutatorian of his class at James Logan High School, with an outstanding GPA, a perfect score on the ACT, and an SAT score of 2230. But he wasn’t just some stereotypical Chinese test-taking robot. He played the piano and founded his high school’s math club. He was a member of his school’s debate team and sang at Barack Obama’s first inauguration ceremony as part of the San Francisco Boys Chorus. He wanted to major in international relations and hoped to become an ambassador one day. On paper, he looked great. The only logical explanation, he concluded, was that he was the victim of racial discrimination, an assertion he has made in interview after interview, most recently in the New Yorker.
In many ways, I fit the description of all of the high-achieving Chinese American students who claim they’re the victims of discrimination. As a high school senior in San Antonio, I was also rejected from every single Ivy League college I had applied to, despite what some might consider a stellar application — I was the valedictorian of my class and had an SAT score that put me in the 99th percentile of everyone who took the test in my year. I’d worked as an editor at my high school paper (where I was the sports editor, no less) and been a member of my school’s academic decathlon team. Yet I had never felt the need to interrogate whether my race had held me back, at least when it came to where I went to college. Maybe I was lucky; my parents put so little pressure on me to do well at school that for years, I had forged their signatures on my report cards. I had never felt that just because I possessed the completely useless ability to be good at taking equally useless tests meant that I deserved anything. I ended up attending a public university and spent four years figuring out what I cared about, and what kind of adult I wanted to be. If I had suffered some sort of theoretical injury by not attending an Ivy, I can find no proof of it.

    <p class="one"> “Normally, Asian women keep their heads down and stay very quiet.”
Those words have been branded into my brain for life by a former boss. I was a budding producer on a national news program, and I had just diplomatically expressed my strong desire to be promoted in the future.
“I’m surprised,” he told me.
“Why?” I asked.
“You’re so good at what you do. I thought you wanted to stay in your position forever ... I’m also not used to hearing you speak up like that.” And then, he uttered those words that stopped me from breathing.
He spoke so matter-of-factly. Though I was stunned, I gave him a weak smile and went back to work, as if validating that pernicious stereotype. I knew he violated some kind of rule but my younger, naïve self didn’t know how to fight back.
I left the network months later with bigger dreams. </p>

  <p class="one"> “Go back to China!”
That ugly exclamation rattled the ears of editor Michael Luo who, with family and friends in tow, headed to get lunch at a nearby Korean restaurant on the Upper East Side streets of Manhattan last month. Luo wrote an open letter in the New York Times to the white woman who roared it, telling her how such verbal daggers sever Asian-Americans from their citizenship. “Maybe you don’t know this,” he penned, “but the insults you hurled at my family get to the heart of the Asian-American experience. It’s this persistent sense of otherness that a lot of us struggle with every day. That no matter what we do, how successful we are, what friends we make, we don’t belong. We’re foreign. We’re not American.”
Upon reading Luo’s open letter, my mind stewed on an uncomfortable truth about people like me who care deeply about racial justice — we often fail at positioning the grievances of Asian-Americans against white supremacy at the heart of the fight. We shower sympathy on black and brown people; Asian-Americans experience but a sprinkle. This begs for amelioration. We must understand that a national conversation about racism that ignores the plight of Asian-Americans carries an unforgivable omission.
Many consider the Asian-American story as bearing relatively few withering marks of traumatic racial struggle, partially explaining why their grievances attract scant attention. But that’s false.</p>
